# FFI Struct Trait

This crate is a supporting library for the `ffi_struct` crate. It provides the `FFIStruct` trait which is used in conjunction with the `ffi_struct_derive` crate to provide an easy way to make a struct iterable in Rust.

**Please note:** This crate is not intended to be used directly. If you want to make your structs iterable, please use the `ffi_struct` crate instead.

Please visit the [`ffi_struct` crate on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ffi_struct) for more information and usage examples.
